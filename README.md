### Running VLM Teleop (TEMPORARY AUG13)
- You will need **3 Terminals open on the workstation** and **1 on Stretch**
- Make sure to **connect your microphone to the workstation**

On **Stretch**, run:
```
stretch_free_robot_process.py
stretch_robot_home.py

cd ~/ament_ws/src/lsy_robot_dev/launch
ros2 launch vlm_teleop_launch
```

On the **Workstation in the first terminal**, run the following commands. This should activate the Speech to Text system make sure to also **plug in a microphone** to the workstation:
```
cd ~ament_ws/src/stretch_embodied_vlm/mic/mic
python3 -m venv mic_env
source mic_env/bin/activate
pip install vosk
pip install pyaudio
python3 local_STT.py
```

On the **second terminal**, run:
```
cd ~/ament_ws
source ./install/setup.bash
cd src/stretch_embodied_vlm/lsy_laptop_dev/lsy_laptop_dev
python3 vision_language_server_copy.py
```

On the **third terminal**, run
```
cd ~/ament_ws
source ./install/setup.bash
cd src/stretch_embodied_vlm/lsy_laptop_dev/lsy_laptop_dev
python3 move_to_object.py
```

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

</div>


### _On the Workstation_
First create a ROS2 Humble workspace and name it ament_ws
```
add instructions here
```

Clone this repository in src:
```
cd ~/ament_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/123orrin/stretch_embodied_vlm.git
```

Now we have to set up the venvs for vlm_teleop and the Speech to Text system:
```
cd ~/ament_ws/src/stretch_embodied_vlm/mic/mic
python3 -m venv mic_env
pip install vosk
pip install pyaudio

cd ~/ament_ws/src/stretch_embodied_vlm/lsy_laptop_dev/lsy_laptop_dev
python3 -m venv vlm_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Finally, build the packages to complete the installation on the workstation:
```
cd ~/ament_ws
colcon build --packages-select lsy_laptop_dev mic lsy_interfaces lsy_robot_dev
```

### _On the Robot_
Clone this repository in ament_ws in src:

```
cd ~/ament_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/123orrin/stretch_embodied_vlm.git

colcon build --packages-select lsy_laptop_dev mic lsy_interfaces lsy_robot_dev
```

</div>

- You will need **3 Terminals open on the workstation** and **1 on Stretch**
- Make sure to **connect your microphone to the workstation**

### On Stretch
Run:
```
stretch_free_robot_process.py
stretch_robot_home.py

cd ~/ament_ws/src/lsy_robot_dev/launch
ros2 launch vlm_teleop_launch
```

### On the Workstation
- Before running VLM Teleop, make sure that **Stretch and the Workstation are connected to the same internet network**. When you run ```ros2 topic list``` in the workstation's terminal, it should show the topics published by the robot

In the **first terminal**, run the following commands. Make sure to also **plug in a microphone** to the workstation:
```
cd ~ament_ws/src/stretch_embodied_vlm/mic/mic
source mic_env/bin/activate

python3 local_STT.py
```

On the **second terminal**, run:
```
cd ~/ament_ws
source install/setup.bash

cd src/stretch_embodied_vlm/lsy_laptop_dev/lsy_laptop_dev
source vlm_env/bin/activate

python3 vision_language_server_copy.py
```

On the **third terminal**, run
```
cd ~/ament_ws
source install/setup.bash

cd src/stretch_embodied_vlm/lsy_laptop_dev/lsy_laptop_dev
source vlm_env/bin/activate

python3 move_to_object.py
```

</div>

### On Stretch
- If a "_process has died_" error is encountered on Stretch, run ```stretch_free_robot_process.py``` and run the command again
- If when running ```ros2 launch vlm_teleop_launch``` and an error similar to "_<< device >> not found_" where the device could be either the gripper or head camera, make sure to double check that the cameras are properly plugged into the robot

### On the Workstation
- If a "_no module named lsy_interfaces_" or "_no module named hello-helpers_" is encountered: run ```source ~/ament_ws/install/setup.bash```
- If you save your code and run it, but only the previous version is run: make sure to colcon build the code every time you change the code
- If move_to_object.py is not receiving verbal commands: Double check that the ROS2 topics being subscribed to in move_to_object.py and published by local_STT.py are the same.
- If local_STT.py is not showing transcribed verbal commands: Ensure that microphone is properly set up. Replug the microphone and  go to your computer settings and ensure that your microphone is set as the device for audio input.
